# Amazon
Amazon item order page clone
# Amazon_2
in the little contirbution I have done so far, I only managed to create the main navbar of the web page, while working on the icons and logos of Amazon and the US flag(fpr the language)
you can see that there was a use of font awesome library
there has been some errors in adjusting the lines and text and also their color.
the logo doesnt fit the backgorung (might have been better to use a different logo, but it does set nicely)

the next part was to create a grid for the main page while the item I had in mind was Coffee beans

Due to harsh time constraints I wasnt able to continue my work on this project, although I might need some notes on how to continue with specific topics,Shhady was notified beforehand on the matter.
